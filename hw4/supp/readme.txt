1080p: Larger LDR and HDR versions of our result images.

ndf-references: Comparison of our NDF evaluation to the reference computed by binning with 100 million samples, for various normal maps in our results, showing very good match. Note that binning computes bin integrals, uses bicubic interpolation over texels, and has some remaining noise, while our method evaluates at bin centers and show some differences from discretization of texels into 32 triangles.
